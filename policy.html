            <h1 class="title">Impact of Air Quality Policies on Public Health in Southeast Asia</h1>
            <p class="description">
                After the major haze crises in 2013 in Singapore and Malaysia, public awareness of PM2.5 pollution significantly increased. The health impacts of fine particulate matter became more apparent, leading to heightened concerns across Southeast Asia. This prompted regional governments and organizations like ASEAN to take action. In this project, we aim to highlight the differences in health outcomes before and after the implementation of air quality policies, showcasing the effectiveness of these measures in reducing the health burden caused by PM2.5, and emphasizing the importance of continued efforts to protect public health in the region.</p>
