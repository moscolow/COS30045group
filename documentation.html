                    In the development of this project, data collection and preparation played a crucial role. The primary data source was the OECD iLibrary, specifically the OECD Environment Statistics, which served as the foundation for meeting the assignment requirements. The dataset encompasses diverse attributes, including categorical attributes for countries, interval attributes for years, and quantitative attributes for values, ensuring comprehensive and structured insights.</p>

                The datasets utilized in this project have been thoughtfully curated and processed from huge amount of data to meet the objectives of our study. Each dataset has been carefully cleaned, organized, and enhanced to deliver accurate and meaningful insights into the Southeast Asia Countries mortality rate caused by ambient particulate matter. Spanning the years 1990 to 2019, these refined datasets are provided below for easy access and download.
