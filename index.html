            <p class="description">
                In Southeast Asia, ambient particulate matter (PM), especially PM2.5, is a major contributor to air pollution, arising from sources like industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and biomass burning. This fine particulate matter poses severe health risks, as it can enter the lungs and bloodstream, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. In 2019, the WHO estimated that outdoor air pollution caused approximately 650,000 deaths in Southeast Asia, with PM2.5 being the leading pollutant. The regionâ€™s rapid urbanization, industrial growth, and reliance on open burning practices exacerbate exposure to PM, making it a critical environmental and public health issue.

            <p class="description-2">
                The aim of this project is to raise awareness among the general public about the health impact of air pollution in Southeast Asia, particularly from ambient particulate matter (PM2.5). We use Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) rather than premature deaths to provide a comprehensive view of the long-term health burden, accounting for both mortality and years lived with illness. Our objective is to highlight age-related differences in mortality, emphasizing vulnerable groups like children and the elderly. Additionally, we aim to showcase the effectiveness of policy interventions by contrasting health outcomes before and after their implementation.
